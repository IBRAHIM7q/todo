# Deployment Notes for Netlify

## Issues Fixed

1. **SQLite Migration Error**: 
   - Fixed PostgreSQL-specific `CREATE TYPE` statements in migration files
   - SQLite doesn't support native enum types, so they are converted to TEXT fields

2. **Prisma Client Engine Issue**:
   - Added `debian-openssl-3.0.x` to binary targets in Prisma schema
   - This ensures the Prisma client can run on Netlify's Linux environment

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Improved the database setup script to handle Netlify deployments
   - Script now creates the database file and runs migrations

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Netlify Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set to `file:./custom.db` in Netlify environment variables

2. **Build Process**:
   - The build process will automatically run `prisma generate` during postinstall
   - The postbuild script will set up the database on Netlify

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If you encounter Prisma engine errors, try clearing the Netlify build cache
   - Ensure the `custom.db` file is properly created during the build process

## Files Modified

- `prisma/migrations/20250916205233_init_tables/migration.sql` - Fixed enum syntax for SQLite
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added Debian binary target
- `scripts/setup-db.js` - Improved error handling
- `package.json` - Updated postinstall script
- `netlify.toml` - Confirmed database URL configuration

## Testing

Before deploying, you can test the build locally:
```bash
npm run build
```

If the build completes successfully, the application should deploy correctly to Netlify.
