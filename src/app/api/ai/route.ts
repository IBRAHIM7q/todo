- Focus time today: ${totalFocusTime} minutes

User's tasks:

User's question: "${query}"

Please provide a helpful but concise response focused on productivity and task management. 
Keep your response under 200 words and focus on the most important advice.

You can:
1. Help prioritize tasks based on importance, deadlines, and estimated time
2. Suggest time estimates for tasks
3. Recommend scheduling strategies based on available focus time
4. Provide productivity tips
5. Help break down complex tasks
6. Identify which tasks are most important based on priority and deadlines

When analyzing tasks, consider:
- High priority tasks should be addressed first
- Tasks with closer deadlines are more urgent
- Estimated time can help with scheduling
- Completed tasks don't need attention

Format your response in a friendly, conversational tone with clear actionable advice.
Use bullet points or numbered lists when providing steps or suggestions.
Be concise and avoid lengthy explanations.`;

ðŸ’¡ **Quick Advice:**
1. Focus on high-priority tasks first (${pendingTasks} remaining)
2. Take breaks every 25-30 minutes (you've focused ${totalFocusTime} min today)
3. Break large tasks into smaller steps

Use the estimated time feature to better plan your day!`;
